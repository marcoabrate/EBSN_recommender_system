# MCLRE - Multi-Contextual Learning to Rank Events

The MCLRE is an event recommendation model that takes into account multiple contextual informations (i.e. social, geographical, content and time) to recommend events in event-based social networks. It was presented in the paper [Context-Aware Event Recommendation in Event-based Social Networks](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2800187) published on [RecSys 2015](http://recsys.acm.org/recsys15/). The paper presentation at RecSysâ€™15 is also available in [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5_rr1__aqw).

This repository contains the MCLRE experimental framework and you can use it to reproduce our experiments and also to evolve the model.

## Requirements

* Linux: all experiments were executed in Linux-based machines, Ubuntu distributions, more specifically

* Database: deploy a local Postgres database and use it as the initial data source to the data partitioning phase.

* Python: run `sudo pip install -r src/requirements.txt`

* R: Every library is going to be installed on demand by the framework


## Running

Follow the steps in the file: [src/run_experiment.sh](https://github.com/augustoqm/mclre/blob/master/src/run_experiment.sh)


## Dataset

For dataset access you should ask *Leandro Balby Marinho* (lbalby_at_gmail_dot_com), he will send it promptly.

Thank you for the interest and have a good job!
